To run the optimization, one needs to run PathUnitTest.py (# Generations can be changed from inside the __call__ method under the PathUnitTest class)
Scenario parameters (Number of drones, Number of cells, cell side length, drone communication range, etc.) can be changed from PathInput.py
Algorithm parameters (crossover, mutation, repair operators, etc.) can be changed from PathAlgorithm.py
